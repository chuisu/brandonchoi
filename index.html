              <p>Trumpeter Brandon Choi comes from the Los Angeles area of Southern California, where his musical growth first began under the guidance of both classical and improvising trumpet teachers.</p>
              <p>While in LA, Brandon performed with Gordon Goodwin, Tom Kubis, and funk band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.</p>
  	    <p>He currently resides in Perrysburg, New York near Buffalo after having finished his degree at the Eastman School of Music, where he studied with professors Clay Jenkins, Bill Dobbins, and Harold Danko; and has played with such luminary musicians as Joe Martin, Jim McNeely, and Bill Holman.</p>
  	    <p>Brandon is very grateful and excited for the opportunity to have music in his life.</p>

          Maybe we should forgo the footer player and instead make the player under mainTitle stick to the top of the window when scrolling down.
          Additionally, it may be cool to have a big 1920x1080 (at least) picture take up the whole screen, then animate shrink down to the div#impression, then blur.
          What should the background behind this look like?
          What colors should we use?
          Need to remember that when the JS gets written for this, it needs to detect endline characters and put breaks in &lt;/br&gt;
